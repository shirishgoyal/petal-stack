If there are duplicate values, then they are all assigned same rank and corresponding rank values are not used anymore.
For example:
Given list = 1, 4, 2, 3, 1
Ranks (ascending) = 1, 5, 3, 4, 1
Ranks (descending) = 4, 1, 3, 2, 4</description></item><item><title>Calculate age from date of birth in Elixir</title><link>https://shirishgoyal.github.io/petal-stack/posts/calculate-age-from-date-of-birth-in-elixir/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 05:42:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shirishgoyal.github.io/petal-stack/posts/calculate-age-from-date-of-birth-in-elixir/</guid><description>Elixir has default modules for Date and Time calculations but lack many functions which are often needed. One of them is calculating age from date of birth. Although 3rd party libraries like Timex do provide some in-built functions to calculate date differences in terms of years, months or days etc., but no such function is directly available for age calculation.
defmodule Calculator do def age(dob) do today = Date.</description></item></channel></rss>
